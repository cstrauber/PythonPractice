##Python Practice

A small set of Python projects following on to a preconference on Python programming at ALA Annual in Chicago in 2013.

Overall goal: Get Python to analyze two spreadsheets and return dates of coverage for covered titles in a scholarly index like MLA Bibliography.

Task 1: Get Python to read a spreadsheet.
Task 2: Get Python to read a spreadsheet and return some data from it.
Task 3: Get Python to recognize ISSN numbers and/or titles (regex)
Task 4: Get Python to match data from one spreadsheet to another
Task 5: Get Python to match ISSN numbers in coverage file against titles in index and return dates of coverage
Task 6: Get Python to write a report re-usable for the web
Task 7: Repeat with other indexes
Task 8: Renown, glory
