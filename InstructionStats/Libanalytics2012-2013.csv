I usually use psychINFO to look for articles, but when I was looking for a specific article, it was not listed in the psychINFO database. Specifically, I was looking for an article: Flanagan, P.J., McGrath, M.M., Meyer, E.C. & Garcia Coll, C.T. (1995). Adolescent development and transitions to motherhood. Pediatrics, 96, 273-277. This does exist in the AcademicOneFile, but when I tried looking for this article using a keyword ""transition* to motherhood"" or author's name, it did not come up in the psychINFO. This worried me a little since I felt I could be missing other articles that may be relevant to my dissertation topic. First, what could be the reason for this specific article for not showing up in the psychINFO database? The topic is definitely related to areas covered under psychINFO. Second, do you have any suggestions for looking for articles that I may be missing? I always have a hard time coming us with keywords to look for articles (Even after attending several workshops at the library); I either get too few articles or too many articles. Thus, I would like to make an appointment to get some support around article researches soon, but I am currently out of the country until end of July, so I thought I'd initiate this conversation before I make an appointment.",,,Graduate students/TAs,"1:1 virtual (email, phone, text, IM, etc)",My desk,Social sciences,Email,0-30 minutes,1,,No,Instruction,,"Kotake, Chie",

Of course, I'd be willing to drive to Tufts if I can't get access online. The database is called African American Newspapers, and it is part of America's Historical Newspapers. The module must cover papers from 1942. I did my dissertation on Richard Wright, and some of these papers that serialized Native Son had illustrations. Here is the link to these illustrations.

Laurie Sabol From: Tara Mount [mailto:tarak.mount@gmail.com] Sent: Monday, March 11, 2013 1:25 AM To: Sabol, Laurie Subject: Purchasing a Zero to Three Journal Hello Ms. Sabol, I'm currently in the preliminary phases of writing a research paper on home visitation programs for my CD 181 class. The latest issue of a journal published by the organization Zero to Three is titled ""Strengthening Home Visiting Through Research"" and would be very helpful in writing my paper. However, it costs $15 to purchase the journal. I was wondering if there is any way the library could get access to the journal, so I don't have to purchase it myself. I know $15 isn't a lot, but being a student I'm kind of pinching pennies.

My OT professor Dr. Scott Trudeau and I recently received a grant from the Tisch Civic Engagement Fund. This will allow us to carry out an exciting project at the Bedford VA GRECC dementia special care unit. We named it the Reading Buddy Program and our goal is to explore the outcomes of one-to-one reading in the dementia population. We are currently matching 8 Tufts OT students with 8 veterans so the pairs will get to know each other over the next few months. The students will choose literature based on the veterans' interests and record their observations. Scott and I are hoping to gain insights from your broad knowledge base and expertise. I have done a preliminary literature search of reading aloud with people who have dementia - found only group-based interventions so far. Do you have time this week to meet? Friday is preferable since I work from home on Fridays and am at the VA M-Th. Although Wednesday (all-day) and Thursday (morning) may work. Of course next week is a possibility, too. Looking forward to hearing back from you!

Quickly reviewed areas to think about: a) not to forget that these topics are interdisciplinary, so consider sources outside the traditional community health resources; c) think topics such as: public health history, mission law; ethical theories – paternalism, respect for autonomy, privacy/confidentiality, common good, beneficence, justice (distributive/participatory) 3. Topics: a) breaking it down into manageable pieces, that is, take the time to think about your topic’s keywords/phrases; b) constructing a keyword/logical search; c) demonstrated Web of Science 4. Cited reference searching: it’s importance and how to do this in Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. 5. Using Google Scholar as a tool – searching it more efficiently and effectively. 6. RefWorks: using Web of Science did a search and showed how to move these into RefWorks; created a bibliography and also showed them how to do in-text citations and bibliography.

I met with you last year and you were very helpful (and I got to sit in your awesome glittery chair). I'm starting the literature review for my thesis on students doing testing and evaluation. I'm having a difficult time finding papers because when I do any sort of search using the word 'evaluation' I get results about how to evaluate students whereas I'm looking for students making decisions and doing evaluations. For example, giving students 7 model cars and having them figure out which one's best. Any suggestions how to perform a better search? I've used other terms like decision making and have still not found anything.
